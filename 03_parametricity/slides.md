### The problem of repetition

Consider the following example definitions

```scala
final case class BoxOfInt(content: Int)
def putInBoxOfInt(aContent: Int): BoxOfInt = BoxOfInt(aContent)

final case class BoxOfString(content: String)
def putInBoxOfString(aContent: String): BoxOfString = BoxOfString(aContent)

final case class BoxOfInstant(content: Instant)
def putInBoxOfInstant(aContent: Instant): BoxOfInstant = BoxOfInstant(aContent)
```

There is a lot of repetition even in this very small example

---

### Avoiding Repetition

The solution in a language without "generics" (like Go) would be to either live
with the repetition or do something like this:

```scala
final case class Box(content: Any)

def putInBox(aContent: Any): Box = Box(aContent)
```

---

### Avoiding Repetition

But then we completely lose track of type information

```scala
val aBoxOfInt: Box = putInBox(42)      // we know that content is Int, but
val content: Int   = aBoxOfInt.content // this won't compile, as content is now Any
```

So a need to typecast all over the place arises

```scala
val aBoxOfInt: Box = putInBox(42)
val content: Int   = aBoxOfInt.content.asInstanceOf[Int]
```

---

### Avoiding Repetition

Programming against top-level types like `Any` breaks all the typesafe
guarantees that the typechecker provides at compile-time

---

### Parametric polymorphism

The better solution in languages with parametric polymorphism (aka generics) is
to make the `Box` type take a **type parameter**:

```scala
final case class Box[A](content: A)

def putInBox[A](aContent: A): Box[A] = Box(aContent)
```

---

### Parametric polymorphism

The better solution in languages with parametric polymorphism (aka generics) is
to make the `Box` type take a **type parameter**:

```haskell
-- Haskell equivalent
data Box a = Box { content :: a }

putInBox :: a -> Box a
putInBox newContent = Box newContent
```

---

### Parametric polymorphism

With this generic version, type information won't be lost:

```scala
val aBoxOfInt: Box[Int] = putInBox[Int](42)
val acontent: Int       = aBoxOfInt.content
```

```haskell
aBox :: Box Integer
aBox = putInBox 42

aContent :: Integer
aContent = content aBox
```

---

### Parametric polymorphism

The types are also correctly inferred by the compiler without type ascriptions

```scala
val aBoxOfInt = putInBox(42)      // inferred as Box[Int]
val acontent  = aBoxOfInt.content // inferred as Int
```

```haskell
aBox     = putInBox 42  -- inferred as Box Integer
aContent = content aBox -- inferred as Integer
```

---

### Parametric functions

Scala functions are **monomorphic**, parametric polymorphism is only supported
on **methods**

```scala
def parametricMethod[A](a: A): A = ???  // ok

val parametricFunction[A]: A => A = ??? // ko, illegal syntax
```

<small>This is getting solved in Scala 3, see [the proof of
concept](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/4672)</small>

---

### Parametric functions

Upon eta-expansion, the generic type gets fixed **at expansion site**:

```scala
def parametricMethod[A](a: A): A = ???

val f1             = parametricMethod _         // f1: Nothing => Nothing
val f2: Int => Int = parametricMethod _         // f2: Int => Int
val f3             = parametricMethod[String] _ // f3: String => String
```

---

### Properties of parametric types

* A generic function can be seen as a function taking a type as input, thus
  becoming a function from type to value

* There is no type-safe way to create a value of a generic type

* There is no type-safe way to introspect information about a value of a
  generic type

---

### Parametricity: Exhibit One

Let's try it:

```scala
def irrelevant[A](as: List[A]): List[A]
```

```haskell
[a] -> [a]
```

* We can assert a lot of things about how this function works

* We can, more importantly, assert what the function **does not** do

---

### Parametricity: Exhibit One

```scala
def irrelevant[A](as: List[A]): List[A]
```

> **Theorem:**
>
> * Every element A in the output list appears also in the input list
> * Contraposed, if A is not in the input list, then it is not in the result

---

### Parametricity: Exhibit Two

Can you think of some theorem satisfied by the following definition?

```scala
def irrelevant[A, B](a: A): B
```

```haskell
irrelevant :: a -> b
```

---

### Parametricity: Exhibit Two

```scala
def irrelevant[A, B](a: A): B
```

> **Theorem:**
>
> This function **never** returns because if it did, it would never have
> compiled

---

### Parametricity: Exhibit Three

Can you think of some theorem satisfied by the following definition?

```scala
def irrelevant[A](something: Option[A]): List[A]
```

```haskell
irrelevant :: Maybe a -> [a]
```

---

### Parametricity: Exhibit Three

```scala
def irrelevant[A](something: Option[A]): List[A]
```

> **Theorems:**
>
> * All the values in the returned list are the same
> * The `A` value in the returned list is the one in Some
> * If the argument is None, then an empty list is returned

### Fast and Loose reasoning

### Fast and Loose reasoning

In our discussion about purity and type cardinality we already covered a minor
problem in our reasoning. Consider:

```scala
def isEven(num: Int): Boolean
```

> **Theorem**:
> The isEven function returns either True or False

---

### Fast and Loose reasoning

But actually, the `isEven` function may not ever return anything:

```scala
def isEven(num: Int): Boolean = isEven(num)

def isEven(num: Int): Boolean = throw new IllegalArgumentException

def isEven(num: Int): Boolean = null
```

Yet, we casually exclude this possibility in discussion, because we presupose
that the function is pure and terminates at some point

---

### Fast and Loose reasoning

This kind of reasoning and exclusion of impure and non-terminating functions is
commonly referred as **fast and loose reasoning**

It is based on the assumption that even if the language is **partial**, we as
functional programmers will restrict the language, and thus benefit from the
same reasoning tools that **total** languages provide

---

### Parametricity and F&L: Challenger One

```scala
def irrelevant[A](x: A): Boolean
```

> Ignores its argument and consistently returns either True or False

---

### Parametricity and F&L: Challenger One

```scala
def irrelevant[A](x: A): Boolean = x.isInstanceOf[Int]
```

> ~~Ignores its argument and consistently returns either True or False~~

**Type-casing** (case-analysis on type) breaks parametricity

---

### Parametricity and F&L: Challenger Two

```scala
def irrelevant[A](as: List[A]): List[A]
```

> Every element A in the output list appears also in the input list

---

### Parametricity and F&L: Challenger Two

```scala
def irrelevant[A](as: List[A]): List[A] = List("abc".asInstanceOf[A])
```

> ~~Every element A in the output list appears also in the input list~~

**Type-casting** breaks parametricity

---

### Parametricity and F&L: Challenger Three

```scala
def irrelevant[A](a: A): Int
```

> Ignores its argument and consistently returns one of the possible 2^32 Int
> values

---

### Parametricity and F&L: Challenger Three

```scala
def irrelevant[A](a: A): Int = a.toString.length
```

> ~~Ignores its argument and consistently returns one of the possible 2^32 Int
> values~~

**Java's Object and Scala's Any** methods break parametricity

---

### Scala's escape hatches

* Scala does indeed have a lot of escape hatches

* This is totally OK from the language perspective

* Scala is purely Object-Oriented with functional capabilities, not the other
  way around

* But can we abandon those escape hatches whout too much penalty?

---

### The Scalazzi Safe Subset

* No **null**
* No **exceptions**
* No **side effects**
* No **type-casing** (`isInstanceOf`)
* No **type-casting** (`asInstanceOf`)
* No **classOf / getClass**
* No **equals / hashCode / toString**
* No **notify / wait**

---

### The Scalazzi Safe Subset

* The **reasoning gets improved**, but at what cost?

* Eliminating those hatches results in minimal, orthogonal, easily-managed
  penalties, resulting in a **significant language improvement** from the FP
  perspective

* All significant **pure functional programming projects** in Scala abide to
  this subset of the language

---

### The Limits of Parametricity

```scala
def thisIsNotReverse[A](as: List[A]): List[A]
```

We know that all the elements of the output appear on the input, but:

* How do we narrow it down?

* How do we rule all possible implementations but one?

---

### The Limits of Parametricity

By Types (proofs) alone, it is not possible to narrow down to one single
possibility in the _general case_. However:

* We can provide one single inhabitant for some specific cases

* We have tools to assist us when coming upon these limitations

* **Types are proof-positive**

* **Tests are proof-negative**

---

### Upper type bounds

`<:` declares an **upper type bound**

`A <: B` means "any generic type A which is a subtype of type B or A itself"

```scala
def example[A <: java.time.Temporal](time: A): A

example(Instant.now())       // compiles
example(LocalDateTime.now()) // compiles
example("12:34:00")          // does not compile
```

---

### Lower type bounds

`>:` declares a **lower type bound**:

`A >: B` means "any generic type A which is a supertype of type B or type A
itself"

```scala
def example[A >: java.time.Instant](instant: A): A

example(Instant.now())                  // compiles
example(new java.time.Temporal { ... }) // compiles
example(LocalDateTime.now())            // does not compile
```

---

### Type variance

Consider the following definitions:

![](/resources/images/03_parametricity.variance_01.png)

```scala
final class VendingMachine[A]

def install(softDrinkVendingMachine: VendingMachine[SoftDrink]): VendingMachine[SoftDrink]
```

---

### Invariance

This VendingMachine, though, is invariant, which means that the following cases
will not work:

```scala
val colaVendingMachine: VendingMachine[Cola] = new VendingMachine[Cola]
val tonicWaterVendingMachine: VendingMachine[TonicWater] = new VendingMachine[TonicWater]

install(colaVendingMachine)       // does not compile
install(tonicWaterVendingMachine) // does not compile
```

Invariance implies that `VendingMachine[Cola]` is not a subtype of
`VendingMachine[SoftDrink]`, so wherever the second one is expected, then the
first one cannot be used

---

### Covariance

If we make VendingMachine covariant (by using the `+` operator):

```scala
final class VendingMachine[+A]

def install(softDrinkVendingMachine: VendingMachine[SoftDrink]): VendingMachine[SoftDrink]

val colaVendingMachine: VendingMachine[Cola] = new VendingMachine[Cola]
val tonicWaterVendingMachine: VendingMachine[TonicWater] = new VendingMachine[TonicWater]

install(colaVendingMachine)       // compiles!!
install(tonicWaterVendingMachine) // compiles!!
```

---

### Covariance

Covariant subtyping provides the generic class `class Foo[+A]` subtyping
information with respect to the generic type `A`:

```scala
AType <: AnotherType => Foo[AType] <: Foo[AnotherType]
```

---

### Legal covariant positions

* In some languages instead of using the randomly-chosen `+` operator, they use
  a `out` keyword to define covariant type parameters.

* This is because contravariant type parameters can only occurr in "output"
  types from methods/functions

  ```scala
  final class VendingMachine[+A] {

    def foo: A          // LEGAL POSITION

    def bar(a: A): Unit // ILLEGAL POSITION, WON'T COMPILE

  }
  ```

---

### Legal covariant positions

To overcome this restriction, upper type bounds tend to be used together with
covariant types when an "input" possition is necessary:

```scala
final class VendingMachine[+A] {

  def bar[B >: A](b: B): Unit // THIS COMPILES!!

}
```

---

### Contravariance

Consider now the following example:

![](/resources/images/03_parametricity.variance_02.png)

```scala
final class GarbageCan[A]

def setGarbageCanForPlastic(can: GarbageCan[PlasticItem]): Unit
```

---

### Contravariance

Intuitivelly, a GarbageCan for Items can be set up as a GarbageCan for Plastic
too, but:

```scala
val garbageCanForItems: GarbageCan[Item] = new GarbageCan[Item]

setGarbageCanForPlastic(garbageCanForItems) // does not compile!!
```

---

### Contravariance

In order to make this work as expected, we need to make the generic type `A`
contravariant with the `-` operator:

```scala
final class GarbageCan[-A]

def setGarbageCanForPlastic(can: GarbageCan[PlasticItem]): Unit

val garbageCanForItems: GarbageCan[Item] = new GarbageCan[Item]

setGarbageCanForPlastic(garbageCanForItems) // it does compile now!!
```

---

### Contravariant

Contravariant subtyping provides the generic class `class Foo[-A]` subtyping
information with respect to the generic type `A`:

```scala
AType >: AnotherType => Foo[AType] <: Foo[AnotherType]
```

---

### Legal contravariant positions

* In some languages instead of using the randomly-chosen `-` operator, they use
  a `in` keyword to define contravariant type parameters.

* This is because contravariant type parameters can only occurr in "input"
  types from methods/functions

  ```scala
  final class GarbageCan[-A] {

    def foo(a: A): Unit // LEGAL POSITION, compiles

    def bar: A          // ILLEGAL POSITION, does not compile

  }
  ```

---

### Legal contravariant positions

To overcome this restriction, upper type bounds tend to be used together with
contravariant types when an "input" possition is necessary:

```scala
final class GarbageCan[-A] {

  def bar[B <: A]: B // THIS COMPILES!!

}
```

---

### Scala's Function Type

Scala's function types are defined somewhat like this:

```scala
trait Function[-Input, +Output] {

  def apply(input: Input): Output

}
```

Contravariant in the input, and covariant in the output

---

### Higher Kinded Types

One of the most powerful features of the Scala type system is its ability to
abstract over things that take type parameters. This feature is known as HKTs
(Higher Kinded Types)

Essentially, HKTs provide the ability to generalizae accross generic type
constructor. For example, `List[_]` is not a type, but a generic type
constructor, so if you pass it a `String` you get a `List[String]` type, and if
you pass it an `Int` you get a `List[Int]` type

---

### Kinds

Kinds are a way to classify generic type constructors by the amount of generic
type parameters that they take

* `List` has kind `(* -> *)`, because it takes one type parameter to return
  another type (given `String` it produces `List[String]`)

* `Map` has kind `(* -> * -> *)`, because it takes two type parameters to
  return a complete type. (given only `String` it will return `Map[String, _]`
  and given `String` and `Int` it will return `Map[String, Int]`)

* And so on...

---

### Kinds

The power of Scala type system lies on the capability of use those **kinds** as
type parameters:

```scala
trait Foo[T[_]]       // T is a (* -> *) kind
trait Bar[T[_, _]]    // T is a (* -> * -> *) kind

new Foo[List] { ... } // OK
new Foo[Map] { ... }  // KO

new Bar[List] { ... } // KO
new Bar[Map]  { ... } // OK
```

---

### Kinds

```scala
trait MappableThing[F[_]] { def map[A, B](fa: F[A], mapper: A => B): F[B] }

object ListMappableThing extends MappableThing[List] {
  def map[A, B](fa: List[A], mapper: A => B): List[B] = fa.map(mapper)
}
```

```scala
def doSomething[F[_]](mappable: MappableThing[F], something: F[Int]): F[String] =
  mappable.map(something, num => num.toString)

doSomething(ListMappableThing, List(1, 2, 3)) // OK, returns List("1", "2", "3")
```

---

### Higher Kinds and Parametricity

Higher kinded types extend a bit the theorems derived from parametricity. In
the previous definition, for example, `doSomething` won't be able to create a
new `F` out of thin air, so the only possible implementation is that it calls
the `map` method in the `mappable` argument

```scala
def doSomething[F[_]](mappable: MappableThing[F], something: F[Int]): F[String] =
  mappable.map(something, num => num.toString)
```
