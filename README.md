Functional Programming in Scala
===============================

To build the HTML version of the slides (`pandoc` must be available in the 
system), run:

```bash
./build
```

HTML versions of the slides will be placed alongside the original markdown
files. For example, the HTML slides of the session `01_functions` will be
generated in file `01_functions/slides.html`.
